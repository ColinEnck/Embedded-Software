# Embedded-Software

This is my journey into embedded programming, for which I shall be using a RPI Pico and the C/C++ SDK that goes with it.
There is a lot of bloat in this repo, that is because I had to include the pico sdk next to my projects.
For the pico, this link was helpful on how to create my own project [https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/pico/getting-started-with-pico.pdf#%5B%7B%22num%22%3A34%2C%22gen%22%3A0%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22XYZ%22%7D%2C115%2C841.89%2Cnull%5D]
